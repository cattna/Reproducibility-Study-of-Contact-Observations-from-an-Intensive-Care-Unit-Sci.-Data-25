    "#### Summary ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data, extracted by API calls to the Instant-Trace system, is compressed into the file `data/fulldata.xz` (the method of compression is LZMA as provided in Python by the lzma module. From `fulldata.xz`, all other forms of the data can be generated. The python code distributed with this notebook is briefly explained below."

    "#### Map Generation ####\n",
    "\n",
    "File `figures/iculayout.png` is adapted from a CAD file of the MICU architecture. File `supp/placement005.yaml` records, in pixel dimensions, where anchors were placed in the MICU with respect to `iculayout.png`. Program `code/showbadge.py` reads these two files and generates a image with red dots indicating locations of the badges during the study. Though these are not needed to process the study data, it could be helpful to see badge coverage. Note: to be able to run `showbadge.py`, you need to install `opencv-python` library (e.g. `pip install opencv-python`) and `scikit-image` library (e.g. `pip install scikit-image`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spreadsheet Notes ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Just prior to the study, our team made notes about badges in a spreadsheet. The file `supp/badgelocations.xlsx` has the spreadsheet. It notes, for instance, room numbers, comments, and at least one case where an anchor malfunctioned and was replaced. Program `code/extractspread.py` reads the spreadsheet. A later program imports from extractspread to obtain patient room numbers for anchor labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contact Intervals ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory (folder) named `data/contact_intervals` has fourteen compressed files of contact intervals, running the program `code/make_intervals.py` creates these files. Please refer to the file for more details on how to read and parse `fulldata.xz`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Histories ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Directory (folder) histories contains fourteen compressed files of badge histories, running program `code/make_histories.py` creates these files. Please refer to the file for more details on how to read and parse the contact intervals in the directory `data/contact_intervals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demonstration Programs ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The program `code/hcplist.py` is a simple demonstration of counting badges observed in each shift, with some datetime arithmetic (the program output shows how some HCPs span shifts)."
